# Time Series Forecasting: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with R & Python

2021-2022

MSc Data Science for Economics, University of Milan

*Overview*

In the last 15 years, business requests related to time series
forecasting changed dramatically. Business needs evolved from predicting
at most 100, low frequency data, to forecasting 10.000, high frequency
time series. Unfortunately, the classical tools may not be the best
anymore, both in terms of accuracy and computationally. Hence, nowadays
the “time series forecasting” data scientist is required to be capable
of providing business forecasting solutions tackling both scalability
and accuracy, constantly keeping up-to-date with new methods.

The aim of the course is to teach how time series forecasting problems
can be solved in practice. The state-of-the-art techniques are presented
from a very practical point of view, throughout **R** tutorials.
**Python** algorithms are also presented and used within R by means of
the reticulate package.

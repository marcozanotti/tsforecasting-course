In the last 15 years, business requests related to time series
forecasting changed dramatically. Business needs evolved from predicting
at most 100, low frequency (mainly monthly or quarterly) data, to
forecasting 10.000, high frequency (mainly daily data) time series.
Unfortunately, the classical tools that were highly used in the past
years may not be the best anymore, both in terms of accuracy and
computationally.
Moreover, the review of M-Series Forecasting Competitions suggests that
newer ML and DL models, or stacking ensemble techniques may be very
accurate compared to easier solutions.

For these reasons, nowadays the "time series forecasting" data scientist
is required to be capable of providing business forecasting solutions
tackling both scalability and accuracy, constantly keeping up-to-date
with new methods.

## Course Structure

The aim of the course is to teach the students how time series
forecasting problems can be solved in practice.
The state-of-the-art techniques are presented from a very practical
point of view, throughout R tutorials on each main topic. Python
algorithms are also presented and used within R by means of the
*reticulate* package. Theoretical concepts are left to those who are
interested in and bibliographic references are listed at the end of the
course.

## Evaluation

Students will be divided into 5 groups and will be asked to compete on a
Time Series Forecasting challenge. They are expected to provide a fully
reproducible project showing the statistical methods used to solve the
forecasting problem at hand.

The evaluation will take into consideration:

-   the correctness of the methods used (10pt)
-   the final average forecasting performance (9pt)
-   the total time spent on developing the project (1pt)
-   the total computation time (1pt)
-   the originality of the approach (5pt)
-   the presentation of results (4pt)

## Duration & Calendar

The course earns 3 ECTS for a total of 20 hours, divided into 7
lectures.
